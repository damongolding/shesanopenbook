				<p>I am a daughter, a wife and a mother. 'She' is the moniker I've had for twenty-something years. I am quite genuinely and unapologetically an open book.</p>
				<p>I'm a trained Information Designer and an experienced team leader. I run engaging creative workshops. I love project planning and strategy and spend a lot of my time defining and prioritising briefs.</p>
				<p>I'm also a conscientious problem-solver. I'm extremely organised. I listen, I ask challenging questions and I work really, really hard.</p>

				<p>I aspire to embed inclusive design principles throughout my work. I design in the medium that will communicate a concept most effectively, adapting the fidelity to gain insight more efficiently.</p>
				<p>I advocate, participate and facilitate in usability testing. </p>
				<p>There are a range of <a href="/work.html">projects</a> on this site that demonstrate my approach, but the content is not exhaustive. If you would like to know more please <a href="/contact.html">send me a message</a>.</p>
