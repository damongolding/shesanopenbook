				<p>I am a daughter, a wife and a mother. 'She' is the moniker I've had for almost twenty years. I am quite genuinely and unapologetically an open book.</p>
				<p>I'm a trained Visual Designer and an experienced team leader. I run engaging creative workshops, I love project planning and strategy and spend a lot of my time defining and prioritising briefs.</p>
				<p>I'm also extremely organised and a conscientious and committed problem-solver. I listen, I ask challenging questions and I work really, really hard.</p>

			<p>You'll find a range of my <a href="/work.html">projects and designs</a> on this site. What you won't see is how I respond to a brief.</p>
			<p>I will adapt my methods to suit my audience and to ensure the right message is being communicated effectively. The decision on what fidelity and format I design in is led by what will gain the most insight efficiently with users.</p>
			<p>As a user-centred designer I advocate inclusivity and aspire to embed good accessibility practices throughout my team and our work.</p>
