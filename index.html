				<p>I am a daughter, wife and mother. 'She' is the moniker I've had for almost twenty years. I am quite genuinely an open book and unapologetically easy to read.
				<p>I'm a trained Visual Designer and an experienced team leader. I run engaging creative workshops, love project planning and strategy and spend a lot of my time defining and prioritising briefs.</p>
				<p>I'm extremely organised and a conscientious and committed problem-solver, both personally and professionally. I listen, I ask challenging questions and I work really, really hard.</p>
				<p>You'll find lots of examples of my <a href="/work.html">projects and design work</a> on this site. And if you want me to talk to me about any of it, or you just fancy a chat you can <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a> via this web form.</p>
