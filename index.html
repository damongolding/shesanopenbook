				<p>I am a daughter, a wife and a mother. 'She' is the moniker I've had for twenty-something years. I am quite genuinely and unapologetically an open book.</p>
				<p>I'm a trained Information Designer and an experienced team leader. I run engaging creative workshops, I love project planning and strategy and spend a lot of my time defining and prioritising briefs.</p>
				<p>I'm also a conscientious problem-solver. I'm extremely organised. I listen, I ask challenging questions and I work really, really hard.</p>

				<p>As a user-centred designer I advocate inclusivity and aspire to embed good accessibility practices throughout my team and our work.</p>
				<p>I design in a medium and fidelity that what will communicate a concept most efficiently. I will adapt my methods to gain insight more effectively.</p>
				<p>There are a range of <a href="/work.html">projects</a> on this site that help demonstrate my approach, but the content is not exhaustive.</p>
