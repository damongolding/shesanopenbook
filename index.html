				<p>I am a daughter, a wife and a mother. 'She' is the moniker I've had for almost twenty years. I am quite genuinely and unapologetically an open book.</p>
				<p>I'm a trained Information Designer and an experienced Team Leader. I run engaging creative workshops, I love project planning and strategy and spend a lot of my time defining and prioritising briefs.</p>
				<p>I'm also extremely organised and a conscientious and committed problem-solver. I listen, I ask challenging questions and I work really, really hard.</p>

				<p>As a user-centred designer I advocate inclusivity and aspire to embed good accessibility practices throughout my team and our work.</p>
				<p>The decision on what medium or fidelity I design in is led by what will communicate an idea most efficiently. I adapt my methods to gain insight most effectively from my audience.</p>
				<p>There are a range of <a href="/work.html">projects</a> on this site that will help demonstrate how I respond to a brief, but the content isn't exhaustive.</p>
