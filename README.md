# She's an open book

## Where are my 'pages'?

They are located in `src/pages`

## Where is my css file?

It is in `public/css/shes-got-style.css`

## Where do I put my images?

You can pop them in `public/assets` and use them as normal e.g. `<img src="/assets/MY_IMAGE.png" />`

Q: I see a assets folder in `/src`, whats that for?
A: You can ignore this. This is an assets folder that Astro can optimise images if wanted but needs some special code in the page to use it.
