				<p>Two years ago I wrote a post (never published) called 'This Too Will Pass', a favourite phrase of my maternal grandmothers, about the things I wish I'd known or wanted to remember about having a baby "incase I managed to have another".</p>

				<p>Today at almost 34 weeks pregnant I'm revisting this list with both abject fear and weary nostalgia. </p>

				<p>On the 4th August 2005, aged 24, the only child of two doting parents bravely said goodbye to his life in the Australian sun and boarded a plane (an A340 for those interested), with the intention of spending one year working in the UK. Exactly one year later I was introduced to that young man and today as his proud wife we will be celebrating 10 years of his life on this tiny island.</p>
