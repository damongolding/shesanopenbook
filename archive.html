				<p>She's writing, she's writing, she's writing a novel,<br>
					She's writing, she's weaving, conceiving a plot,<br>
					It quickens, it thickens, you can't put it down now,<br>
					It takes you, it shakes you, it makes you lose your thought.<br>
					But, you're caught in your own glory,<br>
					You are believing your own stories,<br>
					Writing your own headlines<br>
					Ignoring your own deadlines,<br>
					But now you've gotta' write them all again.<p/>
				<p>You think she's an open book,<br>
					But you don't know which page to turn to,<br>
					Do you?<br>
					You think she's an open book,<br>
					But you don't know which page to turn to,<br>
					Do you, do you, do?</p>
				<p>You want her, confront her, just open your window,<br>
					Unbolt it, unlock it, unfasten your latch,<br>
					You want it, confront it, just open your window,<br>
					All you really have to do is ask.<br>
					But you're caught in your own glory,<br>
					You are believing your own stories,<br>
					Timing your contractions,<br>
					Inventing small contraptions,<br>
					That will roll across your parlor's hardwood floors.</p>
				<p>You think she's an open book,<br>
					But you don't know which page to turn to,<br>
					Do you?<br>
					You think she's an open book,<br>
					But you don't know which page to turn to,<br>
					Do you, do you, do you?</p>
				<p>You think she's an open book,<br>
					But you don't know which page to turn to,<br>
