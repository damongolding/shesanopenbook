                As a highly motivated designer with more than ten years
                experience in Digital I've been fortunate to work in-house,
                client-side, at agencies and with start-ups. I have freelanced,
                trained, mentored, and consulted.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've designed award-winning campaigns, new and refreshed
                identities, communication strategies and visual languages. I've
                built brands, raised revenue (and morale) and formed communities
                to fund charitable works.
