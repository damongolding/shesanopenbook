					A perfect 10

				<p>On the 4th August 2005, aged 24, the only child of two loving parents bravely said goodbye to his life in the Australian sun and boarded a plane (an A340 for those interested), with the intention of spending one year working in the UK. Exactly one year later I was introduced to that young man and today as his proud wife we will be celebrating 10 years of his life on this tiny island.</P>
				<p>–</p>
				<p>But, what of those special people he had to leave at the departure gates of Perth International Airport? I wrote to them, and a few more besides - to see whether they wanted to be a part of this little tribute of mine. Firstly, here's what his parents David and Christine wanted to add.</p>
				<p>"Saying goodbye to our son 10 years ago was a wrench for both of us. Steve had never lived on his own and being a Mum I was worried in case he didn't eat well. (I needn't have worried - he sent us photos of his early days in the UK many of which included food.)</p>
				<p>Steve lived with lots of people of varying nationalities and he used to regale us with funny stories of his many flatmates. He also travelled extensively.</p>
				<p>One of the trips he did in the early years particularly impressed us - a lone trek through Austria to Vienna in mid winter. We learned a lot about his determination and stamina and were fascinated by the DVD he sent us of the journey. We remember that with most of the accommodation closed for the season he had to resort to sleeping in the bath at one hostel.</p>
				<p>The crowning glory of these early years was of course meeting his lovely wife Jo. We couldn't have been happier. Every parent wants their son or daughter (particularly an only son) to have a loving marriage and Jo has given Steve all we could have wished for. He is an extremely lucky man, just as we know Jo is a lucky young woman.</p>
				<p>Ten years have flown by. It is always wonderful to catch up with our son and daughter-in-law when they come down to this part of the world or when we manage to visit them at home. But, much as we miss him, he made a good decision back then and we know the future will be bright for him and his UK family."</p>
				<p>–</p>
				<p>I then spoke to his closest friends, a group of now well-mannered men whom he met aged 12 at Christ Church Grammar School. The conversation went like this... "I shudder to think what Ryan has on some old video tapes but that would be a gold mine." - Wes</p>
				<p>"Unfortunately most of the tapes are now in the possession of the Australian Federal Police (they appropriated them for some sort of crimes against humanity case), but I'll see what I can dig up." - Ryan</p>
				<p>"Dude I thought that was all 'classified'? But yeah great idea Jo." - Arif</p>
				<p>And then the photographs arrived (courtesy of Arif).</p>
				<p>–</p>
				<p>Steve tells me that when he's reunited with these friends he can just pick up where he left off, no matter how much time has past. This is certainly the case for him when he sees the two I call my uncles.</p>
				<p>Nik asks that you listen (as he did) to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuT5KUA7iaY" target="_blank">'Peaches' by The Stranglers</a> whilst you read his contribution.</p>
				<p>"It's after midnight here in Perth. I have finished work and am having a delicious beer and cigarette and thinking about my brother Steve and reflecting on not only his journey physically but also emotionally across 'the pond'. Although I can't imagine what it would have taken to leave Perth at the time, it is something that I respect more than anything.</p>
				<p>I cried when Steve left - since I met him in year nine he has been as much a part of my life as my family. He has been instrumental in teaching me the beauty of travel, friendship and corny as it may sound;- love.</p>
				<p>Now, excuse my somewhat fuzzy recollections (the Stranglers should help) but I have a few things to mention about Perth Steve:</p>
				<p>1. He was the only non-family member to swim in our pool which became a frog pond.</p>
				<p>2. We played Sim City back in '95 in my Dad's study - our city was called for a few stages; 'insert swear word', 'vile' and finally 'Utopia'. I still have the game saved on my mac.</p>
				<p>3. We threw bruised apples at the kids who bullied me which was unforgettable.</p>
				<p>4. When dad got angry at a friend of mine he told me to call Steve because he was a "good man" - I agreed.</p>
				<p>5. We watched the seminal movies of our time together, for the first time (for me anyway);- Reservoir dogs, Pulp fiction, The Matrix, Fear and Loathing, The Big Lebowski.</p>
				<p>6. Steve was there when I drank my first beer and smoked my first cigarette.</p>
				<p>7. He taught me how to be a bit a of rebel. There were BB-gun fights at school after dark and all those trips to Busselton;- late night missions, mud, fire, everything.</p>
				<p>8. We almost sunk his boat and ate pizza afterwards - the best, most warming pizza ever.</p>
				<p>9. We swam on Australian Day and almost drowned.</p>
				<p>10. His BBQs were fucking legendary, so too were his parties - they were fucking amazing. There were pre-event/rave parties, and although I never got past the 'pre' stage we had a blast and Steve was, without exception, the best dressed there.</p>
				<p>I could go on for ever... There is also the post-Perth Steve - who made me travel and adore it, who made me enjoy the Thames, trains, planes, food, the Steve who made me his best man, a highlight of my life - at the highlight of his.</p>
				<p>What I'm trying to say is how much I love him, how much I respect him, and how much I wanted to go buy him a steak when I heard he was eating ready meals when he first got to London all those years ago."</p>
				<p>–</p>
				<p>Lastly, he may have left some beautiful people behind, but he has also made new friends, gained a wife, big brother, little sister, and two very proud parents-in-law. My mum Veronica had this to say about him:</p>
				<p>"He's made my daughter smile. He's made me feel like an accomplished cook;- my lasagne is one of his favourite meals. He's included me on weekends away and we've shared stories whilst he's tried to convince me of the merits of Australian wine. He's been my chauffeur, my mechanic and my tech support. He's my 'special one' (from Oz)."</p>
				<p>–</p>
				<p>I am eternally grateful to the boy who decided to make that epic 14,470km journey, I could not imagine life without him;- my best friend and my soul mate. Thank you x</p>
