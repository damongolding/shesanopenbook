				<h2>
					A perfect 10

				<p>On the 4th August 2005, aged 24, the only child of two loving parents bravely said goodbye to his life in the Australian sun and boarded a plane (an A340 for those interested), with the intention of spending one year working in the UK. Exactly one year later I was introduced to that young man and today as his proud wife we will be celebrating 10 years of his life on this tiny island.</P>
					–
				<p>But, what of those special people he had to leave at the departure gates of Perth International Airport? I wrote to them, and a few more besides - to see whether they wanted to be a part of this little tribute of mine. Firstly, here's what his parents David and Christine wanted to add.</p>
				<p>"Saying goodbye to our son 10 years ago was a wrench for both of us. Steve had never lived on his own and being a Mum I was worried in case he didn't eat well. (I needn't have worried - he sent us photos of his early days in the UK many of which included food.)</p>
				<p>Steve lived with lots of people of varying nationalities and he used to regale us with funny stories of his many flatmates. He also travelled extensively.</p>
				<p>One of the trips he did in the early years particularly impressed us - a lone trek through Austria to Vienna in mid winter. We learned a lot about his determination and stamina and were fascinated by the DVD he sent us of the journey. We remember that with most of the accommodation closed for the season he had to resort to sleeping in the bath at one hostel.</p>
				<p>The crowning glory of these early years was of course meeting his lovely wife Jo. We couldn't have been happier. Every parent wants their son or daughter (particularly an only son) to have a loving marriage and Jo has given Steve all we could have wished for. He is an extremely lucky man, just as we know Jo is a lucky young woman.</p>
				<p>Ten years have flown by. It is always wonderful to catch up with our son and daughter-in-law when they come down to this part of the world or when we manage to visit them at home. But, much as we miss him, he made a good decision back then and we know the future will be bright for him and his UK family."</p>
					–
				<p>I then spoke to his closest friends, a group of now well-mannered men whom he met aged 12 at Christ Church Grammar School. The conversation went like this... "I shudder to think what Ryan has on some old video tapes but that would be a gold mine." - Wes</p>
				<p>"Unfortunately most of the tapes are now in the possession of the Australian Federal Police (they appropriated them for some sort of crimes against humanity case), but I'll see what I can dig up." - Ryan</p>
				<p>"Dude I thought that was all 'classified'? But yeah great idea Jo." - Arif</p>
				<p>And then the photographs arrived (courtesy of Arif).</p>

				<p>1. It's all a phase. The waking up to feed every hour passed but so too did the through-night sleeping. When they're really young a routine takes a long time to establish itself.</p>
				<p>2. The intense attachment you have to your baby might not appear overnight. Some days you will dread them waking up and spend time hiding from them in the loo. But, that emotional bond will develop and wow when it does...</p>
				<p>3. You'll adore everything they do - even the up-the-back poos, the projectile vomit, the laughing in their sleep - all of it. Which means you'll be able to cope with (almost) anything.</p>
				<p>4. Try to stop yourself from seeking approval but do share. Don't allow others to make it a competition, because some mothers do that. Remember, every baby is different.</p>
				<p>5. Trust your instincts. You were born with natural parenting skills so have confidence in yourself. Don't rely on Dr Google.</p>
				<p>6. Don't beat yourself up about the little things, like the baby falling off the bed that first time, or having to give up breastfeeding earlier than planned. Your baby won't remember.</p>
				<p>7. Don't underestimate how much they're learning. When they cry during baby massage or spit out every piece of finger food you've given them for weeks. It will suddenly click one day.</p>
				<p>8. You're allowed to get bored or frustrated. Keeping that baby safe and smiling is exhausting so forgive yourself if you need an hours personal time.</p>
				<p>9. Evenings are just painful. Your baby will be scratchy and not want to be put down and you'll inevitably be exhausted. But, by six months you may be comfortable enough to enlist a parent/babysitter for that long overdue "date night". And think how good that will feel.</p>
				<p>10. Lastly, it took two of you to make that baby so make sure you let each other have a fair share of the good stuff. The reverse is also true of course. Share the shit too, figuratively as well as literally.</p>
