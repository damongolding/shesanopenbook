				<p>Two years ago I wrote a post (never published) called 'This Too Will Pass', a favourite phrase of my maternal grandmothers, about the things I wish I'd known or wanted to remember about having a baby "incase I managed to have another".</p>

				<p>Today at almost 34 weeks pregnant I'm revisting this list with both abject fear and weary nostalgia.</P>
					â€“
				<p>1. It's all a phase. The waking up to feed every hour passed but so too did the through-night sleeping. When they're really young a routine takes a long time to establish itself.</p>
				<p>2. The intense attachment you have to your baby might not appear overnight. Some days you will dread them waking up and spend time hiding from them in the loo. But, that emotional bond will develop and wow when it does...</p>
				<p>3. You'll adore everything they do - even the up-the-back poos, the projectile vomit, the laughing in their sleep - all of it. Which means you'll be able to cope with (almost) anything.</p>
				<p>4. Try to stop yourself from seeking approval but do share. Don't allow others to make it a competition, because some mothers do that. Remember, every baby is different.</p>
				<p>5. Trust your instincts. You were born with natural parenting skills so have confidence in yourself. Don't rely on Dr Google.</p>
				<p>6. Don't beat yourself up about the little things, like the baby falling off the bed that first time, or having to give up breastfeeding earlier than planned. Your baby won't remember.</p>
				<p>7. Don't underestimate how much they're learning. When they cry during baby massage or spit out every piece of finger food you've given them for weeks. It will suddenly click one day.</p>
				<p>8. You're allowed to get bored or frustrated. Keeping that baby safe and smiling is exhausting so forgive yourself if you need an hours personal time.</p>
				<p>9. Evenings are just painful. Your baby will be scratchy and not want to be put down and you'll inevitably be exhausted. But, by six months you may be comfortable enough to enlist a parent/babysitter for that long overdue "date night". And think how good that will feel.</p>
				<p>10. Lastly, it took two of you to make that baby so make sure you let each other have a fair share of the good stuff. The reverse is also true of course - share the shit too, figuratively as well as literally.</p>
